# Exhibit: Constraints and cones

Purpose: Show constraints carve reachability cones and alter EP/clock viability.

Command:
- `python python/scripts/exhibit_constraints_cones_smoke.py`

Expected outputs:
- `artifacts/exhibit_constraints_cones_smoke/metadata.json`

What to look for:
- cone sizes differ across regimes
- EP changes with constraints
- clock metrics shift under protocol constraints
