Time is often treated as a primitive background parameter, and empirical discussions frequently conflate three distinct notions---event ordering, clock measurement, and irreversible directionality---making it difficult to determine when a layer \emph{has time} versus when time is an artifact of description. Building on Six Birds Theory (SBT) \citep{sixbirds_foundations}, we propose a layer-relative account in which time is a \emph{closure artifact} assembled from stable succession (order), staged repeatable carriers (ticks), and irreversible bookkeeping (arrow). We distinguish \emph{causation-time} within a fixed closure from \emph{enablement-time}, where the closure itself is rewritten. We instantiate this account in a finite-state Markov laboratory ($Z=X\times\Phi\times R$) and operationalize it through an audit-and-control workflow: calibrated null regimes, matched controls, and auto-generated evidence tables from reproducible artifacts. We obtain four controlled separations: (i) in a nearly reversible null regime, arrow proxies are $\approx 0$, whereas in a record-coupled driven regime they become decisively nonzero (with absolute irreversibility signaled by $\mathrm{EP}=\infty$); (ii) under consistent estimation, coarse-graining reduces path-space asymmetry (micro $\ge$ macro), preventing ``fake arrows''; (iii) increasing maintenance budget reduces clock drift and failure, while progress metrics detect stall regimes that would otherwise appear stable; and (iv) closure-defect thresholds trigger theory extension only in an enablement regime (not in a no-birth control), and protocol loops exhibit nonzero holonomy in a noncommuting regime but $\approx 0$ under a commuting control, obstructing a global time potential. These results provide a reproducible method for separating arrows, clocks, constraints, and protocol effects, and for clarifying when ``instant updates'' reflect constraints and records rather than causal channels. We do not derive physical spacetime here; our conclusions rely on audited proxies in a minimal laboratory together with lightweight mechanized structural lemmas.
