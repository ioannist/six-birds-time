**Data availability:**
The "data" in this work consist of computationally generated artifacts (JSON metadata files, CSV result tables, and configuration parameters) produced by the included Python scripts. All artifacts are publicly available without restriction in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/ioannist/six-birds-time, directory `artifacts/`) and in the archived Zenodo snapshot (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18595959). No external or third-party datasets were used. To reproduce all artifacts from scratch, run `python python/scripts/run_all_exhibits_smoke.py` from the repository root.

**Code availability:**
Source code is available at https://github.com/ioannist/six-birds-time (MIT license). A permanent DOI-bearing archive of the submission version is deposited at Zenodo under DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18595959.

**Ethics / Human subjects:**
Not applicable; this study involves no human or animal participants and no personal data.

**Generative AI / AI-assisted technologies:**
AI tools were used in three capacities: (1) coding and software scaffolding (Claude Code by Anthropic, ChatGPT by OpenAI) for Python scaffolding, test generation, and build-script debugging; (2) mechanized mathematics (Claude Code) for Lean 4 proof scaffolding and tactic suggestions; (3) text editing (Claude Code and ChatGPT) for copyediting and LaTeX formatting. All scientific content, claims, experimental design, and interpretive conclusions were produced by the author. AI outputs were reviewed, validated, and edited before inclusion. No generative AI was used to create or alter images (this manuscript contains no figures).
